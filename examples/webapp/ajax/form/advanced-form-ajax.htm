In this Ajax example the form <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/" target="_blank" class="external">POSTed</a>
to the server and is then <a href="http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/" target="_blank" class="external">replaced with</a>
a new form returned from the server. This example shows advanced feature such as validation and integrating the DateField
control. For more advanced Ajax Forms (eg. file uploads) have a look at the
<a href="http://jquery.malsup.com/form/">jQuery Form Plugin</a>.
